#	Simple Portable Machine Learning Module

Pseudo-neural-network.
Trainning on Labeled Data Sets with classic optimization
methodes like SGD, Momentum, Adam ...

##	Math

f(x) = 3x + 1
x = 1 
x = x + (want-f(x)) * df(x).1

##	Cvs
Cvs have not to cointain any info on model.
Example with XOR

| 0.0,0.0;0.0 |
| 1.0,0.0;1.0 |
| 0.0,1.0;1.0 |
| 1.0,1.0;0.0 |
